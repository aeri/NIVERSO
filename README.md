This project is a web application in which you can see in real time the data of the quality of **water** and **air** in the different stations, as well as the levels of **pollen** of the city of Zaragoza in a clean and structured way. The user can be informed about relevant news of the city, and can also participate in the notification wall to inform or be informed about incidents or news that may affect all citizens. In addition, the user can establish a series of thresholds for pollen and air levels, so that, if any of these levels is exceeded, the user will be alerted by means of one.

The project is completely free and has all the source code released under the GPL 3.0 license for validation and reuse.

The data used in the application on water, pollen and air have been extracted from the [open data](https://www.zaragoza.es/sede/portal/datos-abiertos/) initiative provided by Zaragoza City Council.
