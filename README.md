# Your health, your world, your life, your app

This project is a web application, in which the data of the water and air quality in the different stations can be seen in real time, as well as the pollen levels of the city of **Zaragoza**. In order for the user to have the information without having to access the data from each station, a warning system has been designed which, if the administrator of the application detects any unusual parameter, warns all the users of the web application. 

In addition, the application allows establishing a series of thresholds for pollen and air levels so that if any of these levels is exceeded, when the user logs in he will be warned if any of the established thresholds have been exceeded.

All the data have been extracted from the different public API services offered by Zaragoza City Council for each of the types of data provided.
